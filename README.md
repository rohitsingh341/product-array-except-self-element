# product-array-except-self-element

There are multiple approaches to solve this problem.

Approach 1 - Get the product of the array and divide it with element while creating a new array

Approach 2 - Brute Force O(n*2) where you iterate in nested way

Approach 3 - Calculate prefixes and set it the new array. And then calculate postfixes and set it in the new array. O(n)
